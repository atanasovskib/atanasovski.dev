# Blagoj Atanasovski

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Cast AI](https://cast.ai) and co-founder of [AdeptCode](https://adeptcode.io).

I work with Kubernetes and Go, currently creating seamless cross-region, cross-cloud capabilities in Kubernetes clusters so you can 
1. reach resources that might be missing in your region without migrating your whole cluster
1. reach cheaper resources
1. connect your own compute with that of managed k8s

Previously Software Engineer at: 
* Reporting Team at Cast AI
* Aequus Ads, which got acquired by Moloco
* [Timescale](https://timescale.com) 
* [Sorsix](https://sorsix.com)

Worked with 
* ClickHouse to aggregate and serve huge amounts of data
* Kotlin and the Spring Framework to build a ad mediation platform with an Open Real Time Bidding exchange
* Built tooling to use TimescaleDB/Postgres as long term storage for Prometheus.
